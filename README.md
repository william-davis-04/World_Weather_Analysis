## Challenge Assignment

Implement feedback from beta testers to determine which changes if any should be incpororated into a brand new app. This feedback includes:

1. A weather description to the pop-up markers for customers so that they know what the weather is as they are traveling.

2. A notation in the search criteria to indicate if it is raining or snowing for customers who are making travel decisions in real-time. 

3. A map that shows the directions for customersâ€™ travel itinerary

To execute this I was asked to incorporate additional data into the database (Cities into the DataFrame), so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker. This includes incorporating the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours so that customers can filter the DataFrame using input statements based on the temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing. Finally add a directions layer Google map that shows the directions between multiple cities for travel.
